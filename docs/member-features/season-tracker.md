# Season tracker

Since the purpose of **OFTracker** was designed not only to make it easy for **organisation admin** to track its **member indebt** on its **organisation**, but also to make that **organisation member** have the transperancy of what's going on in their **organisation cash**, thus let's understand how to **track** your **organisation season cash** to see who's already **paid** for its **indebt** and those who haven't.

In order to do that go to your [season tracker](#season-tracker-section) located in your **member dashboard** page, notice there's a `Season Tracker` button, go hit that button and you'll be redirected to another page called **season tracker** page.
