Since the idea behind **OFTracker** is to made it easy for **admin** to track who's already paid the individual organisation seasonal bill and those who havent, thus its important to understand how to become a **member** in an **organisation** on **OFTracker**.

It is the **organisation member** responsibility to **pay for their individual seasonal indebt** in their **organisation**, thus ofcourse you're need to join an **organisation** because that's the whole purpose of the **OFTracker**.

## A thousand ways to Rome

There are multiple ways to reach the same outcome, well actually there's **two ways** of how you can **join** an **organisation** on **OFTracker**, let's understands how to become a **member** in an **organisation**.

### Send a join request

The first way to become an **organisation member** is to **send** a **join request** to the **organisation** you wanted to **join** with, in order to do that easily type in the **organisation id** in the [join organisation](#member-dashboard-page) section located on your [member dashboard](#member-dashboard-page) page.

Notice that your [member dashboard page](#member-dashboard-page) is now slightly look a bit different, it's showing you the pending status, now you just need to wait for that **organisation admin** with those related **organisation id** to either **accept** or **decline** your **organisation join request**.

And also [notice](#pending-request) that you still could **cancel** your **organisation join request** as long as that **organisation admin** your trying to **join** the **organisation** into haven't decide whether to **accept** or **decline** you **organisation join request**.

### Search an organisation

### Organisation invitation

Now it's up to you as a **member** whether to **accept** or **decline** those **organisation join invitation**.

## Join an organisation

Once you've been accepted by the **organisation admin** into its **organisation**, you'll notice that your [member dashboard](#member-dashboard) looks slightly different, now it has more rich features after you join an **organisation**.

Since the purpose of **OFTracker** was designed not only to make it easy for **organisation admin** to track its **member indbebt** on its **organisation**, but also to make that **organisation member** have the transperancy of what's going on in their **organisation cash**, thus let's understand some of the most important things from the **OFTracker** features.

Notice in your [organisation details](#organisaion-details-section) section, the **organisation cash goal** your **organisation admin** have been set to your **organisation cash goal** is **Rp.6.000.000,00**.

Now in your [personal details](#personal-details-section) section, notice that your **Indebt** is also **Rp.6.000.000,00**

<img src="/img/docs-img-member/join-organisation/join-organisation-8.jpg" id="personal-details-section"/>

It happen because you're the one and only **member** in that **organisation** you just join into, the [formula](#member-indebt-formula) for each **individual organisation member indebt** is simple it's just a basic **math** so here's the [formula](#member-indebt-formula) used to determine how many each **organisation member indebt**:

<img src="/img/docs-img-member/join-organisation/OFTracker-member-indebt-formula.jpg" id="member-indebt-formula"/>

Hence when a **new member** were added to the **organisation**, then **OFTracker** will automatically do the [formula](#member-indebt-formula) above.

Notice how your [indebt](#divided) now have been divided equally, now the **question** is ***"How do i pay my indebt?"*** well you could only **paying** your **indebt bill** when the **organisation season** have been **started** by your **organisation admin**, we'll take a look at more of how to **pay** your **indebt** on this [member features](#member-features) tutorial section.
