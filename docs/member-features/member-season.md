# Member season

Once your successfully **joined** an **organisation**, you'll want to contribute to your **organisation** by **paying** your **personal organisation indebt bill** which distributed by the **organisation admin** on your **organisation**, let's understands how to become a responsible **organisation member** on **OFTracker**.

## Season

In order to be a responsible **organisation member** on **OFTracker** you need to understand how the **OFTracker** work's.

## Understanding season

Since the idea behind **OFTracker** is to made it easy for **admin** to track who's already paid the individual organisation seasonal bill and those who havent, thus its important to understand what is **season** and how it works on **OFTracker**.

### What is a season?

**Season** is designed to make it easy to track who's already paid the **individual organisation indebt bill** and those who havent, there is a **time gap** between one **season** to another **season**, so how long the **time gap** between each **season**? well its the **organisation admin** job to decide of how long the **time gap** is for each **season** and for how long that **season** running, or in the other words it means that it's **organisation admin responsibilty** when to **start** and when to **end** the **organisation season**. 

And as a **member** your main **responsibility** is to **pay** your **individual organisation indebt bill**, quite simple and pretty straightforward right?

## Season idle

It means your current **organisation season** haven't started yet by your **organisation admin**, since only the **organisation admin** that have control when to **start** the **organisation season** and when to **end** the **organisation season**, once your successfully joined an **organisation** [this is](#member-dashboard-idle) how your [member dashboard](#member-dashboard-idle) might looks like:

Dont worry just yet about the other features we'll explain it more soon on this tutorial, Let's focus in the **season status** section on [member dashboard](#member-dashboard-idle) page, notice the ***Season is idle*** status, it's indicating that your **organisation season** haven't started yet, ofcourse theres features a difference when the **organisation season is idle** and when the **organisation season is running**.

## Season running

Now your **organisation season** is **running** which means it's have been started by your **organisation admin**, or in the other words your **organisation season status** is already **started**, well simply when the **season** is already **started** you **can't** **leave** the **organisation** until the **organisation season** were **ended** by your **organisation admin**, but the other advantage is that now you could start **pay** your **indebt bill**.

Notice now your **member dashboard** look's slightly different after the **organisation season** have been started by your **organisation admin**.
