# Create organisation

One of the most important thing to do on OFTracker when registered as an **admin** is to **create organisation**.

## Create new organisation

Create your first organisation

- Login into your existing **admin** account, once you logged in you should see a page like below:

- Click the `create new organisation` button, then you will be prompted for the organisation name and the organisation cash goal.

### Set organisation name and cash goal

Set your **organisation name** and **cash goal** after successfully created an organisation.
    
- **Organisation name** is the name of your organisation.

- **Cash goal**, set your default organisation **seasonal cash goal**, dont worry you could change your seasonal organisation cash goal later as long as the organisation season is not running (season idle).
