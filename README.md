# OFTracker documentation

## Introduction
**OFTracker** was mainly designed for admin so he/she could calmly and neatly track organisation financial cash flow, set its **organisation cash goal**, see who's already paid its **indebt** on your **organisation** and those who haven't, though in the future it may added more features.

## Contributing 
Before you dive in into editing this documentation, please read the OFTracker documentation site so you have a sense of what OFTracker is and how it works.

## N.B
Since this project was mainly built for **[Harvard CS50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CS50) final project** and there's a deadline also this web app only developed by one person only, you  wont see any payment **API** such as **[stripe](https://stripe.com/)** for instance, so yeah what i could say as the developer is that for a while this project is not a production ready in other words it is still a BETA test application.
